**SPLATOON THEME BY YOSHIVA99**
==============
**This is my first time writing a "read me," so bear with me here.**


- THIS TUTORIAL AND THEME IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY
- IT IS ALSO FOR THE DISCORD DARK APPEARANCE ONLY

How to Install
==============
1. Run **BandagedBD.exe** and install it.
2. Open and then exit **Discord**
3. Download the **theme** via clicking on "Clone or download" (the green button at the top of the page) and then clicking "Download ZIP"
4. Install **Splatfont2.ttf**
5. Press the **windows key** and **"r"** at the same time, then type **%appdata%** into the box and hit enter.
6. Navigate to **BetterDiscord>Themes** and then put "Splatoon Theme.theme.css" in there. (Splatoon Theme.theme.css is in the "Theme" folder in this zip.)
7. Open up **Discord**
8. Go to User Settings
9. Scroll down to "Themes"
10. Enable **Splatoon Theme**



And you're good to go!

...if you don't care about plugins.

Plugins
==============
I've included a variety of plugins in this zip that are just generally quality of life improvements for discord, located in the "Optional Plugins" folder in this zip.
1. Navigate back to **%appdata%**, then **BetterDiscord>Plugins** and just drag and drop everything in there.
2. Restart **Discord**.
3. Go to User Settings
4. Scroll down to "Plugins"
5. Enable all of the ones you want.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** 
==============
- After every theme or plugin you install, you must restart Discord to use it!
- Sometimes the plugins will not launch correctly. If this happens, just restart Discord.
- When playing with the settings of plugins, disable the Splatoon theme! It messes with how the plugins' settings look. Once the settings are complete, you can reenable the theme.**
