SPLATOON THEME BY YOSHIVA99

This is my first time writing a "read me," so bear with me here.


NOTE: THIS TUTORIAL AND THEME IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY
	IT IS ALSO FOR THE DISCORD DARK APPEARANCE ONLY

So, first thing you're going to want to do is install Better Discord.
	Run "BandagedBD_NoAdmin.exe" and install it.

Once that's installed, open Discord, and then exit it again.
	Install "Splatfont2.ttf"

After you installed the font, next up you need to put the stuff where it belongs.
	Press the windows key and "r" at the same time, then type "%appdata%" and hit enter.
	Navigate to BetterDiscord>Themes and then put "Splatoon Theme.theme.css" in there. (Splatoon Theme.theme.css is in the "Theme" folder in this zip.)
	Open up Discord
	Go to User Settings
	Scroll down to "Themes"
	Enable "Splatoon_Theme"

And you're good to go!
...if you don't care about plugins.
I've included a variety of plugins in this zip that are just generally quality of life improvements for discord, located in the "Optional Plugins" folder in this zip.
	Navigate back to %appdata%, then BetterDiscord>Plugins and just drag and drop everything in there.
	Restart Discord.
	Go to User Settings
	Scroll down to "Plugins"
	Enable all of the ones you want.

	NOTE: After every theme or plugin you install, you must restart Discord to use it!

	NOTE: Sometimes the plugins will not launch correctly. If this happens, just restart Discord.
	
	NOTE: When playing with the settings of plugins, disable the Splatoon theme! It messes with how the plugins' settings look. Once the settings are complete, you can reenable the theme.
